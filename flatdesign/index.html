                <p>
                    A fan brush can be your best friend. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. This is a fantastic little painting. Everybody needs a friend. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. A happy cloud. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.

                <p>
                    A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. A beautiful little sunset. Let's get wild today. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. A beautiful little sunset. Let's get wild today. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.

                        Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. It's important to me that you're happy. See there, told you that would be easy. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Just make little strokes like that. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Let your heart be your guide. .

                        Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. A happy cloud. You can get away with a lot. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Maybe there's a little something happening right here. This is the fun part And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.
